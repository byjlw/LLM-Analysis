**Home Automation AI/ML Component**
=====================================

In this example, we'll use Python as the primary language, along with popular AI/ML libraries like TensorFlow and scikit-learn. We'll focus on developing a basic predictive model to optimize home automation tasks, such as energy consumption and security monitoring.

**Required Libraries and Tools**
-------------------------------

* Python 3.8+
* TensorFlow 2.4+
* scikit-learn 1.0+
* NumPy 1.20+
* Pandas 1.3+

**Dataset**
------------

For demonstration purposes, we'll use a sample dataset containing information about home automation devices, their usage patterns, and environmental factors. You can replace this with your own dataset or modify it to suit your specific needs.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Sample dataset
data = {
    'device_id': [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3],
    'device_type': ['light', 'thermostat', 'security_camera', 'light', 'thermostat', 'security_camera', 'light', 'thermostat', 'security_camera'],
    'usage_pattern': [0.5, 0.7, 0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.4, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6],
    'temperature': [22, 25, 20, 23, 26, 21, 24, 27, 22],
    'humidity': [50, 60, 40, 55, 65, 45, 58, 62, 52],
    'energy_consumption': [10, 15, 8, 12, 18, 9, 11, 16, 10]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

**Predictive Model**
--------------------

We'll use a simple neural network to predict energy consumption based on device usage patterns, temperature, and humidity.

```python
import tensorflow as tf
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Split dataset into training and testing sets
X = df[['usage_pattern', 'temperature', 'humidity']]
y = df['energy_consumption']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Scale features using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test_scaled = scaler.transform(X_test)

# Define neural network model
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(3,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train model
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32, verbose=0)

# Evaluate model
mse = model.evaluate(X_test_scaled, y_test)
print(f'MSE: {mse:.2f}')
```

**Security Monitoring**
----------------------

To demonstrate a security monitoring system, we can use a simple anomaly detection algorithm to identify unusual patterns in device usage.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest

# Define isolation forest model
if_model = IsolationForest(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)

# Train model on normal device usage patterns
if_model.fit(X_train)

# Predict anomalies
anomaly_scores = if_model.decision_function(X_test)

# Identify anomalies (score < 0)
anomalies = np.where(anomaly_scores < 0)[0]

print(f'Anomalies detected: {len(anomalies)}')
```

This code provides a basic example of how you can use AI/ML techniques to optimize home automation tasks and detect anomalies in device usage patterns. You can modify and extend this code to suit your specific requirements and integrate it with your home automation system.
