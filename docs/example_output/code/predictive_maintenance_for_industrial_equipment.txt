**Predictive Maintenance using Python and scikit-learn**

### Introduction

This code provides a basic example of a predictive maintenance system using Python and scikit-learn. We'll use a simple machine learning approach to predict the likelihood of equipment failure based on sensor data.

### Dependencies

* Python 3.8+
* scikit-learn 1.0+
* pandas 1.3+
* numpy 1.20+
* matplotlib 3.4+ (for visualization)

### Code
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load sample data (replace with your own data)
data = pd.read_csv('equipment_data.csv')

# Preprocess data
X = data.drop(['failure'], axis=1)  # features
y = data['failure']  # target variable

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train a random forest classifier
rfc = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rfc.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = rfc.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
print("Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
print("Confusion Matrix:")
print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred))

# Use the model to make predictions on new data
new_data = pd.DataFrame({'temperature': [50, 60, 70], 'vibration': [0.5, 0.6, 0.7]})
new_pred = rfc.predict(new_data)
print("Predicted failure probabilities:", new_pred)

# Visualize the results
plt.scatter(X_test['temperature'], X_test['vibration'], c=y_test)
plt.xlabel('Temperature')
plt.ylabel('Vibration')
plt.title('Equipment Failure Data')
plt.show()
```
### Explanation

This code uses a random forest classifier to predict equipment failure based on temperature and vibration sensor data. The model is trained on a sample dataset and evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix. The model is then used to make predictions on new data, and the results are visualized using a scatter plot.

### Notes

* Replace the sample data with your own data and adjust the feature engineering and preprocessing steps as needed.
* Tune the hyperparameters of the random forest classifier to improve the model's performance.
* Consider using more advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning or gradient boosting, for better results.
* Integrate this code with your existing infrastructure and systems, such as EAM or CMMS, to deploy the predictive maintenance system.

### Example Use Cases

* Predicting equipment failure in a manufacturing plant
* Identifying potential issues in a wind turbine farm
* Optimizing maintenance schedules for a fleet of vehicles

### Advice

* Collect and preprocess high-quality data to improve the model's accuracy.
* Monitor the model's performance over time and retrain as needed.
* Consider using techniques such as feature engineering, regularization, and ensemble methods to improve the model's robustness.
