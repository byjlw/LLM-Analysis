**Smart Home Automation: Energy Consumption Forecasting using Machine Learning**

In this example, we'll use Python and the TensorFlow library to build a simple energy consumption forecasting model. We'll assume that we have a dataset containing historical energy consumption data for a smart home, along with relevant features such as temperature, humidity, and time of day.

**Dataset Assumptions**

For this example, we'll assume that our dataset is a CSV file containing the following columns:

* `date`: a timestamp representing the date and time of the energy consumption reading
* `temperature`: the temperature in degrees Celsius
* `humidity`: the humidity level as a percentage
* `energy_consumption`: the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh)

**Required Libraries and Packages**

* `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
* `numpy` for numerical computations
* `scikit-learn` for data preprocessing and feature engineering
* `tensorflow` for building and training the machine learning model
* `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

**Code**
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
from tensorflow.keras.layers import LSTM, Dense
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('energy_consumption_data.csv')

# Convert the date column to a datetime object
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

# Extract relevant features from the date column
df['hour'] = df['date'].dt.hour
df['day_of_week'] = df['date'].dt.dayofweek

# Define the feature and target variables
X = df[['temperature', 'humidity', 'hour', 'day_of_week']]
y = df['energy_consumption']

# Scale the feature variables using Min-Max Scaler
scaler = MinMaxScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Define the LSTM model architecture
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(LSTM(units=50))
model.add(Dense(1))

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Reshape the input data for the LSTM model
X_train = np.reshape(X_train, (X_train.shape[0], X_train.shape[1], 1))
X_test = np.reshape(X_test, (X_test.shape[0], X_test.shape[1], 1))

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=32, verbose=2)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model using mean absolute error (MAE)
mae = np.mean(np.abs(y_test - y_pred))
print(f'MAE: {mae:.2f}')

# Visualize the predicted energy consumption
plt.plot(y_test, label='Actual')
plt.plot(y_pred, label='Predicted')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```
**Explanation**

This code uses a simple LSTM model to forecast energy consumption based on historical data. The model takes into account the temperature, humidity, hour of the day, and day of the week as input features. The `MinMaxScaler` is used to scale the feature variables, and the `train_test_split` function is used to split the data into training and testing sets. The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error as the loss function. The `mean_absolute_error` metric is used to evaluate the model's performance.

Note that this is a simplified example, and you may need to modify the code to suit your specific requirements and dataset. Additionally, you may want to experiment with different model architectures, hyperparameters, and techniques (e.g., feature engineering, regularization) to improve the model's performance.
