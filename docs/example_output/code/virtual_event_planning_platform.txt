**Virtual Event Planning Platform: AI/ML Components**

For the AI/ML portions of the virtual event planning platform, I'll focus on the following components:

1. **Event Recommendation System**: Recommend relevant events to attendees based on their interests, preferences, and past event attendance.
2. **Attendee Segmentation**: Segment attendees into groups based on their demographics, interests, and behavior to facilitate targeted marketing and event planning.
3. **Event Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze attendee feedback and sentiment to improve event quality and identify areas for improvement.

**Tech Stack:**

* Programming Language: Python
* Machine Learning Framework: scikit-learn, TensorFlow
* Deep Learning Framework: Keras
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) Library: NLTK, spaCy
* Data Storage: Pandas, NumPy

**Event Recommendation System:**
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load event data
events = pd.read_csv('events.csv')

# Create a TF-IDF vectorizer for event descriptions
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words='english')
event_vectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(events['description'])

# Create a cosine similarity matrix for event vectors
similarity_matrix = cosine_similarity(event_vectors)

# Define a function to recommend events based on user interests
def recommend_events(user_interests, num_recommendations=5):
    # Get the index of the most similar events
    similarities = cosine_similarity(vectorizer.transform([user_interests]), event_vectors)
    top_indices = similarities.argsort()[0, ::-1][:num_recommendations]
    
    # Return the recommended events
    return events.iloc[top_indices]

# Example usage:
user_interests = 'Machine learning and AI'
recommended_events = recommend_events(user_interests)
print(recommended_events)
```

**Attendee Segmentation:**
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load attendee data
attendees = pd.read_csv('attendees.csv')

# Select relevant features for clustering
features = attendees[['age', 'interests', 'past_events']]

# Scale the features using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_features = scaler.fit_transform(features)

# Perform K-means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=5)
clusters = kmeans.fit_predict(scaled_features)

# Assign cluster labels to attendees
attendees['cluster'] = clusters

# Example usage:
print(attendees.head())
```

**Event Sentiment Analysis:**
```python
import pandas as pd
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load event feedback data
feedback = pd.read_csv('feedback.csv')

# Create a SentimentIntensityAnalyzer object
sia = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Define a function to analyze sentiment
def analyze_sentiment(text):
    # Get the sentiment scores
    scores = sia.polarity_scores(text)
    
    # Determine the sentiment label
    if scores['compound'] >= 0.05:
        return 'Positive'
    elif scores['compound'] <= -0.05:
        return 'Negative'
    else:
        return 'Neutral'

# Apply the sentiment analysis function to the feedback data
feedback['sentiment'] = feedback['text'].apply(analyze_sentiment)

# Example usage:
print(feedback.head())
```

These code snippets demonstrate the AI/ML components of the virtual event planning platform. The event recommendation system uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to recommend events based on user interests. The attendee segmentation component uses K-means clustering to segment attendees into groups based on their demographics and interests. The event sentiment analysis component uses NLTK's VADER sentiment analysis tool to analyze attendee feedback and determine the sentiment label.
