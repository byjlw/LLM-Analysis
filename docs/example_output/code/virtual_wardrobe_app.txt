**Fashion Outfit Recommendation System using TensorFlow and PyTorch**

We'll focus on building a recommendation system that suggests outfits based on user preferences and fashion trends. We'll use a combination of computer vision and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze images and text data.

**Dataset**

For this example, we'll assume we have a dataset containing:

* Images of fashion products (e.g., clothing, accessories)
* Text descriptions of each product (e.g., brand, style, color, fabric)
* User ratings and reviews for each product

Let's use the following dataset:

* `fashion_products.csv`: contains image URLs, text descriptions, and product metadata
* `user_ratings.csv`: contains user IDs, product IDs, and rating values (1-5)

**Preprocessing**

First, we'll preprocess the image and text data using the following steps:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from PIL import Image
from torchvision import transforms
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel

# Load datasets
products_df = pd.read_csv('fashion_products.csv')
ratings_df = pd.read_csv('user_ratings.csv')

# Define image preprocessing pipeline
image_transform = transforms.Compose([
    transforms.Resize(256),
    transforms.CenterCrop(224),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
])

# Define text preprocessing pipeline
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

def preprocess_text(text):
    inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors='pt', max_length=512, padding='max_length', truncation=True)
    outputs = model(**inputs)
    return outputs.last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]
```

**Computer Vision Model**

We'll use a pre-trained CNN (e.g., ResNet50) to extract features from the product images:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision import models

class ComputerVisionModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(ComputerVisionModel, self).__init__()
        self.cnn = models.resnet50(pretrained=True)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(2048, 128)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.cnn(x)
        x = x.view(-1, 2048)
        x = self.fc(x)
        return x

cv_model = ComputerVisionModel()
cv_model.eval()
```

**NLP Model**

We'll use a pre-trained BERT model to extract features from the product text descriptions:

```python
class NLPModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(NLPModel, self).__init__()
        self.bert = model

    def forward(self, x):
        x = preprocess_text(x)
        return x

nlp_model = NLPModel()
nlp_model.eval()
```

**Recommendation Model**

We'll use a simple neural network to combine the computer vision and NLP features and predict user ratings:

```python
class RecommendationModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(RecommendationModel, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(128 + 768, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, 1)

    def forward(self, cv_features, nlp_features):
        x = torch.cat((cv_features, nlp_features), dim=1)
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

recommendation_model = RecommendationModel()
```

**Training**

Let's train the recommendation model using the preprocessed data:

```python
import torch.optim as optim

# Define loss function and optimizer
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(recommendation_model.parameters(), lr=0.001)

# Train the model
for epoch in range(10):
    for batch in range(len(products_df) // 32):
        cv_features = cv_model(image_transform(Image.open(products_df.iloc[batch*32:(batch+1)*32]['image_url'])))
        nlp_features = nlp_model(products_df.iloc[batch*32:(batch+1)*32]['text_description'])
        ratings = ratings_df.iloc[batch*32:(batch+1)*32]['rating']
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        outputs = recommendation_model(cv_features, nlp_features)
        loss = criterion(outputs, ratings)
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, Loss: {loss.item()}')
```

**Inference**

Let's use the trained model to recommend outfits for a given user:

```python
def recommend_outfits(user_id, num_recommendations):
    user_ratings = ratings_df[ratings_df['user_id'] == user_id]
    user_cv_features = cv_model(image_transform(Image.open(user_ratings['image_url'])))
    user_nlp_features = nlp_model(user_ratings['text_description'])
    recommendations = []
    for product in products_df:
        cv_features = cv_model(image_transform(Image.open(product['image_url'])))
        nlp_features = nlp_model(product['text_description'])
        rating = recommendation_model(cv_features, nlp_features)
        recommendations.append((product, rating))
    recommendations.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    return recommendations[:num_recommendations]

user_id = 1
num_recommendations = 5
recommendations = recommend_outfits(user_id, num_recommendations)
print(recommendations)
```

This code provides a basic framework for building a fashion outfit recommendation system using computer vision and NLP techniques. You can refine and improve the model by incorporating additional features, such as user demographics, product categories, and seasonal trends.
