**AI-driven Chatbots for Customer Onboarding Instructions**

**Outline:**

1. **Architecture:**
	* Local Machine Learning (ML) model for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
	* Integration with Node.js backend
	* MongoDB database for storing chatbot interactions and customer data
2. **ML Model:**
	* Choose a suitable NLP library (e.g. TensorFlow.js, Brain.js)
	* Train a model for intent detection and response generation
	* Deploy the model locally on the client-side (mobile devices, web browsers)
3. **Inference:**
	* Create a JavaScript module for loading and running the ML model
	* Use the module to process user input and generate responses
4. **Training:**
	* Prepare a dataset for training the ML model
	* Train the model using the dataset and evaluate its performance

**Instructions for the Engineer:**

1. **Choose an NLP Library:**
Select a suitable JavaScript NLP library (e.g. TensorFlow.js, Brain.js) for building and training the ML model.
2. **Prepare the Dataset:**
Collect and prepare a dataset for training the ML model, including examples of customer interactions and corresponding responses.
3. **Train the Model:**
Train the ML model using the prepared dataset and evaluate its performance on a test set.
4. **Create the Inference Module:**
Create a JavaScript module for loading and running the trained ML model, using the chosen NLP library.
5. **Integrate with Node.js Backend:**
Integrate the inference module with the Node.js backend, using MongoDB to store chatbot interactions and customer data.
6. **Test and Evaluate:**
Test and evaluate the performance of the chatbot, using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

**Deliverables:**

* A trained ML model for intent detection and response generation
* A JavaScript module for loading and running the ML model
* Integration with Node.js backend and MongoDB database
* Test results and evaluation metrics

Note: The instructions focus on the core AI/ML functionality, without providing code or unnecessary context. The engineer is expected to use the provided details to implement the chatbot functionality.
