**AI-driven Content Generation for Social Media: Instructions for Engineer**

**Overview**
The goal of this project is to implement an AI-driven content generation system for social media, using the company's existing JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB, and React tech stack.

**Architecture Outline**

1. **Data Collection**
	* Connect to MongoDB to collect social media post data
	* Preprocess data for training (e.g., tokenization, normalization)
2. **Model Training**
	* Train a language model (e.g., LSTM, Transformer) using the collected data
	* Use a library like TensorFlow.js or Brain.js for training
3. **Model Inference**
	* Use the trained model to generate new social media content
	* Integrate with React frontend to display generated content
4. **Content Evaluation**
	* Develop a evaluation metric to assess generated content quality
	* Use this metric to fine-tune the model and improve content generation

**AI/ML Portions to be Built**

1. **Language Model**
	* Implement a language model architecture (e.g., LSTM, Transformer)
	* Train the model using the collected social media post data
2. **Content Generation**
	* Use the trained language model to generate new social media content
	* Integrate with React frontend to display generated content
3. **Content Evaluation Metric**
	* Develop a metric to evaluate generated content quality
	* Use this metric to fine-tune the model and improve content generation

**Local Inference/Training**

* Train and deploy the language model locally on the server or cloud infrastructure
* Use a library like TensorFlow.js or Brain.js to enable local inference and training

**Next Steps**

1. Research and implement a suitable language model architecture
2. Develop a content evaluation metric to assess generated content quality
3. Integrate the language model with the React frontend to display generated content

Note: This outline provides a high-level overview of the architecture and AI/ML portions to be built. The engineer will need to fill in the details and implement the necessary code to bring this project to life.
