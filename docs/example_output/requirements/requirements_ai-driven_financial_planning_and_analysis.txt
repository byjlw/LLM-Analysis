To implement the AI-driven Financial Planning and Analysis product, I will provide instructions for the AI/ML portions of the project. Here is the outline:

```json
{
  "Project Overview": {
    "Product Idea": "AI-driven Financial Planning and Analysis",
    "Problem it solves": "Provides personalized financial recommendations",
    "Software Techstack": ["Java", "Spring Boot", "PostgreSQL", "React"],
    "Target hardware": ["Web browsers", "Mobile devices"]
  },
  "AI/ML Architecture": {
    "Components": [
      "Data Preprocessing",
      "Model Training",
      "Model Inference"
    ],
    "Model": {
      "Type": "Supervised Learning",
      "Algorithm": "Random Forest"
    }
  },
  "Instructions for Engineer": {
    "Task 1": "Data Preprocessing",
    "Task 2": "Model Training",
    "Task 3": "Model Inference"
  },
  "Model Training": {
    "Data": "Financial data from PostgreSQL database",
    "Features": ["Income", "Expenses", "Savings", "Debts"],
    "Target Variable": "Financial Health Score"
  },
  "Model Inference": {
    "Input": "User financial data",
    "Output": "Personalized financial recommendations"
  }
}
```

To implement the AI/ML portions of the project, the engineer will need to:

1. Preprocess the financial data from the PostgreSQL database.
2. Train a Random Forest model using the preprocessed data.
3. Implement model inference to generate personalized financial recommendations based on user input.

Note: The instructions will focus on the core AI/ML functionality, and the engineer will need to integrate the AI/ML components with the existing Java, Spring Boot, and React stack.
