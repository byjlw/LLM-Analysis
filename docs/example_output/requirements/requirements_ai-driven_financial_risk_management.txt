Here is the outline for implementing the AI-driven Financial Risk Management product:

```json
{
  "Product Idea": "AI-driven Financial Risk Management",
  "Problem it solves": "Helps businesses manage financial risk",
  "Software Techstack": ["Python", "Django", "PostgreSQL", "Vue.js"],
  "Target hardware": ["Web browsers", "Mobile devices"],
  "Company profile": "Financial services software",
  "Engineering profile": ["Data scientists", "engineers"],
  "Instructions": {
    "Architecture": {
      "Components": [
        "Data Ingestion",
        "Data Preprocessing",
        "Model Training",
        "Model Inference"
      ],
      "Technology": {
        "Programming Language": "Python",
        "Libraries": ["TensorFlow", "Keras", "Scikit-learn"]
      }
    },
    "AI/ML Portions": {
      "Model": "Financial Risk Prediction Model",
      "Algorithm": "Supervised Learning",
      "Task": "Binary Classification (High/Low Risk)",
      "Features": ["Financial Metrics", "Market Data", "Company Performance"]
    },
    "Inference": {
      "Input": "Financial data",
      "Output": "Risk score (High/Low)"
    },
    "Training": {
      "Dataset": "Historical financial data",
      "Label": "Risk score (High/Low)"
    }
  }
}
```

Next steps would be to provide more details on the model architecture, data preprocessing, and training/inference scripts. 

Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with the next steps. 

Note: The above response is similar to the example provided, and it focuses on the core AI/ML functionality of the product idea.
