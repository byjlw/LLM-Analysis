**AI-driven Predictive Maintenance for Automotive: Implementation Outline**

### Overview

To implement the AI-driven predictive maintenance system, we will focus on building a machine learning model that can analyze data from IoT sensors and telematics systems to predict potential vehicle failures.

### Architecture

The architecture for the AI-driven predictive maintenance system will consist of the following components:

* **Data Ingestion**: Collect data from IoT sensors and telematics systems
* **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the collected data
* **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data
* **Model Inference**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data
* **Integration**: Integrate the model with the existing Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL stack

### Implementation Outline

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
	* Handle missing values and outliers
	* Normalize and scale the data
	* Split data into training and testing sets
2. **Model Training**:
	* Choose a suitable algorithm (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
	* Train the model using the training data
	* Evaluate the model's performance using metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)
3. **Model Inference**:
	* Use the trained model to make predictions on new data
	* Implement a threshold-based system to determine the likelihood of vehicle failure
4. **Integration**:
	* Integrate the model with the existing Java, Spring Boot, and MySQL stack
	* Use the predictions to trigger maintenance alerts and notifications

### Model Requirements

* **Input**: Sensor data from IoT sensors and telematics systems
* **Output**: Predicted likelihood of vehicle failure
* **Model Type**: Supervised learning model (e.g., classification, regression)

### Next Steps

The engineer will implement the data preprocessing, model training, and model inference components using a suitable machine learning library (e.g., Weka, Deeplearning4j) in Java. The model will be trained and tested locally using the collected data. The integration with the existing stack will be done using RESTful APIs or other suitable integration methods.
