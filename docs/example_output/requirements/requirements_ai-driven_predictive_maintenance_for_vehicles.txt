To implement the AI-driven Predictive Maintenance for Vehicles, I will provide instructions for the engineer to focus on the core AI/ML functionality. Here is the outline:

**Architecture:**

* Data Collection: IoT sensors on vehicles will collect data (e.g., temperature, vibration, pressure) and send it to a local storage system.
* Data Preprocessing: The collected data will be preprocessed using Python to handle missing values, normalize the data, and transform it into a suitable format for model training.
* Model Training: A predictive maintenance model will be trained using the preprocessed data to predict the likelihood of vehicle downtime or repair.
* Model Inference: The trained model will be used to make predictions on new, incoming data from the IoT sensors.

**Portions to be Built:**

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Write a Python script to handle data preprocessing, including data cleaning, normalization, and transformation.
2. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) using the preprocessed data to predict vehicle downtime or repair.
3. **Model Inference**: Write a Python script to use the trained model to make predictions on new data from the IoT sensors.

**Instructions:**

1. Collect and preprocess the data from the IoT sensors using Python.
2. Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data to predict vehicle downtime or repair.
3. Implement model inference using the trained model to make predictions on new data from the IoT sensors.
4. Integrate the model inference script with the Angular frontend to display the predictions to the user.

**Model Requirements:**

* The model should be able to handle multiple types of sensor data (e.g., temperature, vibration, pressure).
* The model should be able to predict the likelihood of vehicle downtime or repair.
* The model should be trained using a local dataset to avoid relying on cloud-based services.

**Testing:**

* Test the data preprocessing script to ensure it handles missing values and normalizes the data correctly.
* Test the model training script to ensure it produces a model with high accuracy.
* Test the model inference script to ensure it makes accurate predictions on new data.

Note: I will not provide code, as per the instructions. The engineer will need to implement the outlined architecture and functionality using Python, focusing on the core AI/ML aspects of the project.
