To implement the AI-driven Predictive Modeling for Financial Forecasting, I will provide instructions for the engineer to build the core functionality. Here is the outline:

  "Project Overview": {
    "Product Idea": "AI-driven Predictive Modeling for Financial Forecasting",
    "Problem it solves": "Improves financial forecasting and reduces risk"
  },
  "Architecture": {
    "Components": [
      "Data Ingestion",
      "Data Preprocessing",
      "Model Training",
      "Model Inference"
    ],

      "R",
      "Shiny",
      "PostgreSQL",
      "Tableau"
    ]
  },
  "Instructions": {
    "Data Ingestion": {
      "Task": "Connect to PostgreSQL database and retrieve financial data",
      "Requirements": [
        "Use R libraries to connect to PostgreSQL",
        "Retrieve relevant financial data"
      ]
    },
    "Data Preprocessing": {
      "Task": "Clean and preprocess financial data for modeling",
      "Requirements": [
        "Handle missing values",
        "Normalize data",
        "Transform data as necessary"
      ]
    },
    "Model Training": {
      "Task": "Train a predictive model using R",
      "Requirements": [
        "Choose a suitable algorithm (e.g. ARIMA, LSTM, etc.)",
        "Train the model using the preprocessed data"
      ]
    },
    "Model Inference": {
      "Task": "Use the trained model to make predictions on new data",
      "Requirements": [
        "Use the trained model to make predictions",
        "Output predictions in a suitable format"
      ]
    }
  },
  "Deliverables": {
    "Code": "R code for data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, and inference",
    "Model": "Trained predictive model",
    "Tests": "Unit tests and integration tests to verify functionality"
  }
}
```

The engineer should focus on building the core functionality of the predictive modeling pipeline, using R and the specified techstack. The instructions outline the key components and tasks required to implement the project. The deliverables include the R code, trained model, and tests to verify the functionality.
