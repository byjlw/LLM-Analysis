To implement the AI-driven Quality Inspection for Manufacturing, I will provide instructions for the AI or ML portions of the project. Here is the outline:

**Architecture:**

* Data Ingestion: Collect images from industrial cameras and machine vision systems
* Data Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, and enhance images using OpenCV
* Model Training: Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) using C++ and OpenCV to detect defects
* Model Inference: Use the trained model to classify images as defective or non-defective
* Data Storage: Store images and classification results in SQLite database

**Portions to be Built:**

1. **Data Preprocessing Module**:
	* Input: Images from industrial cameras and machine vision systems
	* Output: Preprocessed images
	* Functionality: Resize, normalize, and enhance images using OpenCV
2. **Model Training Module**:
	* Input: Preprocessed images and labels (defective or non-defective)
	* Output: Trained CNN model
	* Functionality: Train a CNN using C++ and OpenCV to detect defects
3. **Model Inference Module**:
	* Input: Preprocessed images
	* Output: Classification results (defective or non-defective)
	* Functionality: Use the trained model to classify images
4. **Data Storage Module**:
	* Input: Images and classification results
	* Output: Stored data in SQLite database
	* Functionality: Store images and classification results in SQLite database

**Instructions for the Engineer:**

1. Implement the Data Preprocessing Module using OpenCV to resize, normalize, and enhance images.
2. Implement the Model Training Module using C++ and OpenCV to train a CNN to detect defects.
3. Implement the Model Inference Module using the trained model to classify images.
4. Implement the Data Storage Module using SQLite to store images and classification results.
5. Integrate the modules to create a complete AI-driven Quality Inspection system.

Note: The instructions focus on the core functionality of the AI-driven Quality Inspection system, and do not include details on the non-AI or ML functionality. The system will run locally, and will not use AI or ML services.
