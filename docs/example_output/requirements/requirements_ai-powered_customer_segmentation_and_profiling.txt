Here is the instructions for the engineer:

**AI-powered Customer Segmentation and Profiling Project**

**Architecture Outline:**

1. Data Collection: Connect to PostgreSQL database to retrieve customer data
2. Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess customer data using R
3. Model Training: Train a clustering model (e.g. K-Means) using R to segment customers
4. Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model in a Shiny app for inference
5. Inference: Use the deployed model to predict customer segments for new customers

**Instructions for Engineer:**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
	* Write R code to connect to PostgreSQL database and retrieve customer data
	* Clean and preprocess customer data (e.g. handle missing values, normalize/scale data)
2. **Model Training**:
	* Train a clustering model (e.g. K-Means) using R to segment customers based on preprocessed data
	* Evaluate model performance using metrics (e.g. silhouette score)
3. **Model Deployment**:
	* Deploy the trained model in a Shiny app for inference
	* Create a RESTful API to accept new customer data and return predicted segment
4. **Inference**:
	* Write R code to accept new customer data and pass it through the deployed model
	* Return predicted customer segment

**Requirements:**

* Use R for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment
* Use Shiny app for model deployment and inference
* Use PostgreSQL database for data storage
* Ensure model is trained and deployed locally (no cloud services)

**Deliverables:**

* R code for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment
* Shiny app for model deployment and inference
* RESTful API for accepting new customer data and returning predicted segment
* Tests to prove model performance and accuracy
