Here is the outline for the AI-powered Medical Diagnosis project:

```
{
  "Project Overview": {
    "Problem Statement": "Improve medical diagnosis accuracy and reduce diagnosis time",
    "Target Hardware": "Medical imaging devices, Clinical decision support systems"
  },
  "Architecture": {
    "Components": [
      "Data Ingestion",
      "Data Preprocessing",
      "Model Training",
      "Model Inference",
      "Integration with Existing System"
    ]
  },
  "AI/ML Portion": {
    "Task": "Medical Diagnosis",
    "Model Type": "Image Classification",
    "Model Requirements": {
      "Input": "Medical images",
      "Output": "Diagnosis prediction"
    }
  },
  "Instructions for Engineer": {
    "Step 1": "Design and implement data ingestion pipeline to collect medical images and corresponding diagnosis labels",
    "Step 2": "Develop data preprocessing techniques to normalize and augment medical images",
    "Step 3": "Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using the preprocessed data for medical diagnosis",
    "Step 4": "Implement model inference using the trained model to predict diagnosis for new medical images",
    "Step 5": "Integrate the AI/ML model with the existing clinical decision support system using Flask and PostgreSQL"
  }
}
```

Note that I've kept it simple and focused on the core functionality of the AI/ML portion of the project. I've also outlined the architecture and the components that need to be built, without providing any code. The engineer can then use this outline to implement the AI/ML model and integrate it with the existing system.
