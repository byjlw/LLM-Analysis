To implement the AI-powered Personalized Advertising product, I will provide instructions for the AI/ML portions of the project. Here is the outline:

**Architecture:**

* Data Collection: Collect user data and ad interaction data from PostgreSQL database
* Data Preprocessing: Preprocess data using Python and relevant libraries (e.g. Pandas, NumPy)
* Model Training: Train a personalized advertising model using a suitable algorithm (e.g. Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering)
* Model Inference: Use the trained model to generate personalized ad recommendations for users
* Integration: Integrate the AI/ML model with the existing Flask API and Vue.js frontend

**Portions to be built:**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
	* Load user and ad interaction data from PostgreSQL database
	* Preprocess data by handling missing values, normalization, and feature engineering
2. **Model Training**:
	* Choose a suitable algorithm for personalized advertising (e.g. Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering)
	* Train the model using the preprocessed data
	* Evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics (e.g. precision, recall, F1-score)
3. **Model Inference**:
	* Use the trained model to generate personalized ad recommendations for users
	* Implement a function to take in user data and return a list of recommended ads
4. **Integration**:
	* Integrate the AI/ML model with the existing Flask API
	* Use the API to serve personalized ad recommendations to the Vue.js frontend

**Instructions for the Engineer:**

1. Implement the data preprocessing step using Python and relevant libraries.
2. Train a personalized advertising model using a suitable algorithm and evaluate its performance.
3. Implement the model inference step to generate personalized ad recommendations for users.
4. Integrate the AI/ML model with the existing Flask API and Vue.js frontend.

**Output:**

The output of the AI/ML model should be a list of recommended ads for a given user, along with their corresponding scores or probabilities. The engineer should ensure that the model is trained and evaluated on a local machine, and that the inference step can be executed locally without relying on any external AI/ML services.
