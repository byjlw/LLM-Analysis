Here are the instructions for the engineer to implement the AI-powered Predictive Modeling for Climate Change:

**Outline**

1. **Data Preparation**
	* Collect and preprocess climate-related data from various sources
	* Store data in PostgreSQL database
2. **Model Training**
	* Use R to train a machine learning model for climate change prediction
	* Utilize a suitable algorithm (e.g. linear regression, decision trees, random forests)
3. **Model Deployment**
	* Create a Shiny app to deploy the trained model
	* Allow users to input parameters and generate predictions
4. **Inference and Visualization**
	* Use the trained model to make predictions on new data
	* Visualize predictions using Tableau

**Architecture**

* Data Warehouse (PostgreSQL): stores climate-related data
* Data Engineering (R): trains machine learning model
* Shiny App: deploys trained model and generates predictions
* Tableau: visualizes predictions

**Instructions for Engineer**

1. Prepare the data by collecting and preprocessing climate-related data from various sources.
2. Train a machine learning model using R, utilizing a suitable algorithm for climate change prediction.
3. Deploy the trained model using Shiny, allowing users to input parameters and generate predictions.
4. Use the trained model to make predictions on new data and visualize the results using Tableau.
5. Ensure the model is trained and deployed locally, without relying on AI or ML services.

**Requirements**

* R version: latest
* Shiny version: latest
* PostgreSQL version: latest
* Tableau version: latest
* Data: climate-related data (e.g. temperature, precipitation, sea level rise)
