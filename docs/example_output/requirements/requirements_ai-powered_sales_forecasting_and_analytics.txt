Here is the outline for the AI-powered Sales Forecasting and Analytics project:

}
```

Note that I've kept the outline simple and focused on the core functionality of the AI-powered Sales Forecasting and Analytics project. I've also avoided adding unnecessary context and focused on the AI/ML portions of the project. The instructions for the engineer are high-level and provide a clear outline of the tasks that need to be completed.
