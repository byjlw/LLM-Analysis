Here are the instructions for the engineer:

**Automated Quality Control for Manufacturing using Computer Vision**

**Outline**

1. **Architecture**
	* Industrial cameras will capture images of products on the production line
	* Machine vision systems will process these images using OpenCV
	* C++ and Qt will be used for building the application
	* SQLite will be used for storing and retrieving product quality data
2. **Core Functionality**
	* Image acquisition and preprocessing
	* Defect detection using computer vision algorithms
	* Classification of defects (e.g. scratch, dent, etc.)
	* Decision-making for product quality control (accept/reject)
3. **AI/ML Portions**
	* Train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for defect detection and classification
	* Use OpenCV for image processing and feature extraction
	* Implement a classification algorithm (e.g. SVM, k-NN) for defect classification

**Instructions for Engineer**

1. **Image Acquisition and Preprocessing**
	* Use OpenCV to capture images from industrial cameras
	* Apply necessary image preprocessing techniques (e.g. resizing, thresholding, etc.)
2. **Defect Detection and Classification**
	* Train a CNN using a dataset of images with labeled defects
	* Use OpenCV to extract features from images and feed into the CNN
	* Implement a classification algorithm to classify defects
3. **Decision-Making for Product Quality Control**
	* Use the output of the classification algorithm to decide whether to accept or reject a product
	* Store the decision in SQLite database for future reference
4. **Testing and Validation**
	* Test the system using a dataset of images with known defects
	* Validate the accuracy of the defect detection and classification algorithm

**Notes**

* Use C++ and Qt for building the application
* Use OpenCV for computer vision tasks
* Use SQLite for storing and retrieving product quality data
* Train and test the CNN using a local dataset of images with labeled defects
