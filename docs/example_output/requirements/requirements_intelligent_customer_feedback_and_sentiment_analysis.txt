**Intelligent Customer Feedback and Sentiment Analysis Instructions**

### Outline

1. **Architecture**
	* Data Collection: React frontend will send customer feedback to Flask backend API
	* Data Storage: PostgreSQL database will store customer feedback
	* ML Model: Local Python-based sentiment analysis model will be trained and deployed
2. **Machine Learning Model**
	* **Task**: Sentiment Analysis (Binary Classification: Positive/Negative)
	* **Model**: Simple Neural Network or Naive Bayes Classifier
	* **Training Data**: Existing customer feedback data stored in PostgreSQL database
	* **Inference**: Local Python-based model will analyze new customer feedback
3. **Components to be Built**
	* **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess customer feedback data for training and inference
	* **Model Training**: Train the sentiment analysis model using the preprocessed data
	* **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model in the Flask backend API
	* **Inference API**: Create a Flask API endpoint to receive new customer feedback and return sentiment analysis results

### Instructions for Engineer

1. **Prepare the Environment**
	* Install required Python libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` (or other ML libraries of choice)
	* Set up a local PostgreSQL database and create a table to store customer feedback data
2. **Collect and Preprocess Data**
	* Collect existing customer feedback data from the PostgreSQL database
	* Preprocess the data by tokenizing, removing stop words, and converting to numerical representations
3. **Train the Model**
	* Split the preprocessed data into training and testing sets
	* Train a simple neural network or Naive Bayes Classifier using the training data
	* Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data
4. **Deploy the Model**
	* Deploy the trained model in the Flask backend API
	* Create a Flask API endpoint to receive new customer feedback and return sentiment analysis results
5. **Inference and Testing**
	* Test the inference API endpoint with sample customer feedback data
	* Verify that the model returns accurate sentiment analysis results

### Notes

* The engineer should focus on building a simple and effective sentiment analysis model using local Python-based ML libraries.
* The model should be trained and deployed locally, without relying on AI or ML services.
* The instructions provided are for the core functionality of the Intelligent Customer Feedback and Sentiment Analysis feature, and do not include non-ML related functionality.
