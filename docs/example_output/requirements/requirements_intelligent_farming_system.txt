THE IDEA
Design and develop an intelligent farming system that uses IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms to optimize crop yields and reduce waste by at least 20% within the first two years of implementation. The system should be able to monitor soil moisture, temperature, pH levels, and other environmental factors such as sunlight, humidity, and wind speed to provide farmers with real-time data and personalized recommendations for irrigation, fertilization, and pest control. Implement a user-friendly interface for farmers to interact with the system, including a mobile app and web portal, and ensure it is integrated with existing farming equipment and practices, such as tractors, planters, and harvesters, to minimize disruptions to daily operations. Success will be measured by increased crop yields, reduced water and fertilizer usage, and improved farmer engagement, with key performance indicators (KPIs) including a 15% increase in crop yields, a 10% reduction in water usage, and a 90% farmer adoption rate within the first year.
