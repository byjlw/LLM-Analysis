Here are the instructions for the engineer to implement the Intelligent Network Optimization feature:

**I. Introduction**
The goal of this project is to implement an Intelligent Network Optimization feature that improves network performance and reduces costs. This feature will utilize machine learning (ML) to analyze network traffic and optimize network settings.

**II. Architecture Outline**
The architecture for this feature will consist of the following components:

* **Data Collector**: Responsible for collecting network traffic data from network devices
* **Data Preprocessor**: Responsible for preprocessing the collected data for ML model training
* **ML Model**: A local ML model that will be trained on the preprocessed data to predict optimal network settings
* **Optimizer**: Responsible for applying the predicted optimal network settings to the network devices

**III. ML Portion**
The ML portion of this project will involve:

* **Model Selection**: A suitable ML algorithm (e.g. decision tree, random forest) will be selected for training a model to predict optimal network settings
* **Model Training**: The selected model will be trained on the preprocessed data using a local training setup
* **Model Inference**: The trained model will be used to make predictions on new, unseen data

**IV. Implementation Instructions**
The engineer will need to:

* Implement the Data Collector component using Java and Spring Boot to collect network traffic data from network devices
* Implement the Data Preprocessor component using Java and Spring Boot to preprocess the collected data
* Implement the ML Model using a local ML library (e.g. Weka, Deeplearning4j) and train the model on the preprocessed data
* Implement the Optimizer component using Java and Spring Boot to apply the predicted optimal network settings to the network devices
* Integrate the ML model with the Optimizer component to enable real-time predictions and optimization

**V. Local Training and Inference**
The ML model will be trained and used for inference on a local setup, without relying on any cloud-based AI or ML services.

Note: The specific details of the ML algorithm, model selection, and training data will be determined by the engineer based on the requirements of the project.
