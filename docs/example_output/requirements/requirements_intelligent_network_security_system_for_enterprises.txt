**Instruction Outline for Intelligent Network Security System**

### I. Introduction
The goal is to develop an Intelligent Network Security System for enterprises using C++, Qt, SQLite, and OpenCV. The system will utilize machine learning (ML) to improve network security and reduce cybersecurity risks.

### II. Architecture
The architecture will consist of the following components:
* **Data Collection**: Collect network traffic data from network devices and security appliances.
* **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the collected data using OpenCV for feature extraction.
* **Model Training**: Train a ML model using the preprocessed data to detect cybersecurity threats.
* **Model Inference**: Use the trained model to detect threats in real-time network traffic.

### III. ML Components
The following ML components need to be built:
* **Threat Detection Model**: Develop a model using C++ and OpenCV to detect cybersecurity threats.
* **Model Training Script**: Create a script to train the model using the collected data.
* **Model Inference Script**: Create a script to use the trained model for real-time threat detection.

### IV. Implementation
The implementation will involve:
* **Data Collection Module**: Develop a module using C++ and Qt to collect network traffic data.
* **Data Preprocessing Module**: Develop a module using OpenCV to preprocess the collected data.
* **Model Training Module**: Develop a module to train the ML model using the preprocessed data.
* **Model Inference Module**: Develop a module to use the trained model for real-time threat detection.

### V. Local Deployment
The system will be deployed locally on network devices and security appliances.

### VI. Next Steps
The next steps will be to:
* Develop the data collection and preprocessing modules.
* Train the ML model using the collected data.
* Develop the model inference module.
* Integrate the modules to create the Intelligent Network Security System.
