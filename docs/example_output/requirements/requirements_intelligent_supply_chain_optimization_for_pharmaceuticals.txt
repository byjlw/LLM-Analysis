**Intelligent Supply Chain Optimization for Pharmaceuticals**

**Architecture Outline**

To implement the Intelligent Supply Chain Optimization for Pharmaceuticals, we will focus on building a predictive model using Machine Learning (ML) to forecast demand and optimize inventory levels. The architecture will consist of the following components:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Collect historical data on supply chain operations, including inventory levels, demand, and shipment information from PostgreSQL.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data using R to prepare it for modeling.
3. **Model Training**: Train a predictive model using R to forecast demand and optimize inventory levels.
4. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model using Shiny to create a web-based interface for data engineers and analysts to interact with the model.
5. **Inference**: Use the deployed model to make predictions on new data and provide recommendations for supply chain optimization.

**Instructions for Engineer**

To implement the ML portions of the project, please follow these instructions:

1. **Data Ingestion**:
	* Connect to the PostgreSQL database to retrieve historical data on supply chain operations.
	* Use R to extract relevant features from the data, such as inventory levels, demand, and shipment information.
2. **Data Preprocessing**:
	* Use R to clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and normalization.
	* Split the data into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% for training and 20% for testing).
3. **Model Training**:
	* Use R to train a predictive model (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, or Prophet) on the training data to forecast demand and optimize inventory levels.
	* Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
4. **Model Deployment**:
	* Use Shiny to create a web-based interface for data engineers and analysts to interact with the trained model.
	* Deploy the model to a server or data warehouse, ensuring scalability and reliability.
5. **Inference**:
	* Use the deployed model to make predictions on new data and provide recommendations for supply chain optimization.
	* Integrate the model with Tableau for data visualization and reporting.

**Deliverables**

Please provide the following deliverables:

* A trained predictive model that can forecast demand and optimize inventory levels
* A Shiny web-based interface for data engineers and analysts to interact with the model
* A report detailing the model's performance, including metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall
* A data visualization dashboard using Tableau to display the model's predictions and recommendations
