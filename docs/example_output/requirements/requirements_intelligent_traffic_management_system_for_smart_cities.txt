  }
}
```

Note that I've kept the outline simple and focused on the core functionality of the Intelligent Traffic Management System. I've also identified the AI/ML portions of the project, which include the Video Processing Module and the Traffic Flow Analysis Module. The instructions for the engineer are clear and concise, and provide a good starting point for implementing the system.
