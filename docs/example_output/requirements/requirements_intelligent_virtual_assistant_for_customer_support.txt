To implement the Intelligent Virtual Assistant for Customer Support, I will provide instructions for the AI/ML portions of the project. Here is the outline:

**Architecture:**

* Natural Language Processing (NLP) Module:
	+ Text Preprocessing
	+ Intent Detection
	+ Entity Extraction
* Machine Learning Model:
	+ Train a model to classify customer inquiries into predefined categories (e.g., billing, technical issues, etc.)
* Inference Engine:
	+ Use the trained model to predict the category of new customer inquiries

**Components to be Built:**

1. **NLP Module:**
	* Tokenization
	* Stopword removal
	* Stemming/Lemmatization
	* Named Entity Recognition (NER)
2. **Machine Learning Model:**
	* Train a supervised learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine) on a labeled dataset of customer inquiries
	* Use techniques such as TF-IDF, word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe) to transform text data into numerical features
3. **Inference Engine:**
	* Load the trained model and use it to predict the category of new customer inquiries
	* Integrate with the NLP Module to preprocess incoming text data

**Technical Requirements:**

* Use Node.js and MongoDB to store and manage the training data and model artifacts
* Utilize a library such as TensorFlow.js or Brain.js for building and training the machine learning model
* Implement the NLP Module using a library such as NLTK or spaCy

**Instructions for the Engineer:**

1. Design and implement the NLP Module to preprocess incoming customer inquiries
2. Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data and a suitable algorithm
3. Develop the Inference Engine to load the trained model and predict the category of new customer inquiries
4. Integrate the NLP Module and Inference Engine with the existing Node.js and Express backend
5. Use React to create a user interface for customers to interact with the virtual assistant

Note: The instructions will focus on the AI/ML portions of the project, and the engineer will need to integrate the developed components with the existing software stack.
