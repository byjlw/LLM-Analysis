Design and develop an AI-powered virtual wardrobe application that allows users to upload high-quality pictures of their clothing items, including tops, bottoms, dresses, outerwear, and accessories, and create a virtual closet with categorized and tagged items. The application should be able to suggest outfit combinations based on the user's preferences, such as formal or casual events, weather forecasts, and occasions like weddings or job interviews, using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to learn the user's style and preferences over time. The engineer should use computer vision and machine learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks and collaborative filtering, to analyze the clothing items, identify patterns and textures, and generate personalized recommendations, including mixing and matching items the user already owns and suggesting new purchases to complete the look. The application should also allow users to share their virtual wardrobe with friends and family, and provide a social platform for users to discover new fashion trends and styles, follow influencers and bloggers, and participate in discussions and polls to rate and review outfits, with features such as likes, comments, and shares, and integration with popular social media platforms. Success will be measured by user engagement, with key metrics including the number of outfits created, the frequency of use, and the overall satisfaction of users with the application's recommendations, as well as the growth of the user community and the number of users who make purchases based on the application's suggestions.
