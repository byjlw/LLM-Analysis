**Predictive Analytics for Cybersecurity Threat Detection**

**Architecture Outline**

1. **Data Collection**: Collect cybersecurity threat data from various sources (e.g., network logs, system calls, etc.) and store it in a MongoDB database.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Preprocess the collected data using Node.js to create a suitable format for training a machine learning model.
3. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Network) using the preprocessed data to predict cybersecurity threats.
4. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model on a local server or cloud infrastructure to make predictions on new, unseen data.
5. **Inference**: Use the deployed model to make predictions on new data and return the results to the React frontend.

**AI/ML Portions to be Built**

1. **Data Preprocessing Module**: Create a Node.js module to preprocess the collected data, including data cleaning, feature extraction, and normalization.
2. **Machine Learning Model**: Train a machine learning model using a library such as TensorFlow.js or Brain.js to predict cybersecurity threats.
3. **Model Serving**: Create a Node.js server to serve the trained model and make predictions on new data.

**Instructions for the Engineer**

1. Implement the data preprocessing module using Node.js to create a suitable format for training a machine learning model.
2. Train a machine learning model using a library such as TensorFlow.js or Brain.js to predict cybersecurity threats.
3. Deploy the trained model on a local server or cloud infrastructure using Node.js.
4. Create a RESTful API to receive new data and return predictions from the deployed model.
5. Integrate the model serving API with the React frontend to display the predicted results.
