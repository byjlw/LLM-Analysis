### Predictive Analytics for Financial Risk Management Instructions

#### Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive analytics system for financial risk management using machine learning (ML) techniques. The system will utilize the company's existing tech stack, including R, Shiny, PostgreSQL, and Tableau.

#### Architecture Outline
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Collect financial data from various sources.
   - Store the data in PostgreSQL.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Clean and preprocess the data using R.
   - Handle missing values and outliers.
   - Transform data into suitable formats for modeling.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Develop a predictive model using R (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, random forests) to forecast financial risk.
   - Train the model on the preprocessed data.

4. **Model Deployment**:
   - Deploy the trained model in a Shiny application for interactive prediction and visualization.
   - Use Tableau for additional data visualization and insights.

5. **Inference**:
   - Use the deployed model to make predictions on new, unseen data.
   - Integrate the predictions into the company's financial risk management workflow.

#### Instructions for the Engineer
1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Ensure R, Shiny, PostgreSQL, and Tableau are installed and configured.
   - Set up a local development environment for testing and training.

2. **Data Preparation**:
   - Write R scripts to connect to the PostgreSQL database and retrieve relevant financial data.
   - Implement data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation steps.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Research and select appropriate ML algorithms for financial risk prediction.
   - Develop, train, and evaluate the models using R.

4. **Model Integration and Deployment**:
   - Create a Shiny application to deploy the trained model.
   - Integrate the model with Tableau for visualization and reporting.

5. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Develop tests to validate the model's performance and accuracy.
   - Conduct thorough testing of the entire system, including data ingestion, preprocessing, model predictions, and visualization.

#### Next Steps
- Review the company's data privacy and security policies to ensure compliance.
- Collaborate with data engineers and analysts to ensure seamless integration with existing systems.
- Plan for model maintenance, updates, and retraining as necessary.
