**Predictive Analytics for Supply Chain Optimization Instructions**

### Outline

1. **Architecture**
	* Data Ingestion: Collect historical data from MySQL database
	* Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess data for training
	* Model Training: Train a predictive model using Java and Spring Boot
	* Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model for inference
	* Inference: Use the deployed model to make predictions on new data
2. **Machine Learning Portions**
	* **Data Preprocessing**
		+ Handle missing values
		+ Normalize/scale data
	* **Model Selection**
		+ Choose a suitable algorithm (e.g., regression, decision trees, random forest)
	* **Model Training**
		+ Train the model using the preprocessed data
	* **Model Evaluation**
		+ Evaluate the model's performance using metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall)
3. **Inference**
	* **Input**
		+ New data to make predictions on
	* **Output**
		+ Predicted values (e.g., inventory levels, delivery times)

### Instructions for Engineer

1. **Data Ingestion**
	* Connect to the MySQL database and retrieve historical data
	* Store the data in a suitable format for preprocessing
2. **Data Preprocessing**
	* Write Java code to handle missing values and normalize/scale the data
	* Use libraries like Apache Commons or Spring Boot's built-in utilities
3. **Model Selection and Training**
	* Choose a suitable algorithm and implement it using Java and Spring Boot
	* Train the model using the preprocessed data
	* Evaluate the model's performance using metrics
4. **Model Deployment**
	* Deploy the trained model as a RESTful API or a Java library
	* Ensure the model can be easily updated or retrained as needed
5. **Inference**
	* Write Java code to make predictions on new data using the deployed model
	* Return the predicted values in a suitable format (e.g., JSON)

### Notes

* Ensure the solution is scalable and can handle large datasets
* Use Tableau to visualize the predictions and provide insights to stakeholders
* Collaborate with data engineers and analysts to ensure the solution meets the company's needs and is properly integrated with existing systems.
