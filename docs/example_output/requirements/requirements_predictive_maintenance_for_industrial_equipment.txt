THE IDEA
Develop a predictive maintenance system for industrial equipment that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze sensor data, such as temperature, vibration, and pressure readings, and predict when maintenance is required, thereby minimizing unplanned downtime and reducing maintenance costs by up to 30%. The system should alert maintenance personnel of potential issues, such as equipment failure or performance degradation, before they occur, allowing for scheduled maintenance and reducing downtime by up to 25%. Integrate the system with existing equipment, such as pumps, motors, and gearboxes, and ensure it is scalable and adaptable to different industries, including manufacturing, oil and gas, and transportation, and equipment types, including rotating equipment, hydraulic systems, and electrical systems. Success will be measured by a reduction in mean time between failures (MTBF), an increase in mean time to repair (MTTR), and a decrease in overall maintenance spend, resulting in increased overall efficiency, reduced costs, and improved profitability.
