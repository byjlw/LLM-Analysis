**Predictive Quality Control for Manufacturing: AI/ML Implementation Instructions**

**Outline**

1. **Architecture**
	* Data Ingestion: Collect data from industrial machines and quality control devices
	* Data Preprocessing: Clean and normalize data for training and inference
	* Model Training: Train a machine learning model to predict quality issues
	* Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model for local inference on industrial machines and quality control devices
2. **AI/ML Components**
	* **Data Preprocessing**: Implement data preprocessing using Java and Spring Boot
	* **Model Training**: Train a supervised learning model (e.g. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) using a Java-based ML library (e.g. Weka, Deeplearning4j)
	* **Model Inference**: Implement model inference using Java and Spring Boot, with integration with Angular for visualization
3. **Local Inference**
	* Implement local inference on industrial machines and quality control devices using Java and Spring Boot

**AI/ML Implementation Details**

1. **Data Preprocessing**
	* Handle missing values and outliers
	* Normalize data using techniques such as Min-Max Scaler or Standard Scaler
2. **Model Training**
	* Split data into training and testing sets
	* Train a supervised learning model using the training data
	* Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall
3. **Model Inference**
	* Load the trained model into memory
	* Use the model to make predictions on new, unseen data
	* Integrate with Angular for visualization of predictions and quality control metrics

**Next Steps**

1. Implement data preprocessing and model training using Java and Spring Boot
2. Implement local inference on industrial machines and quality control devices using Java and Spring Boot
3. Integrate with Angular for visualization and testing of the predictive quality control system
