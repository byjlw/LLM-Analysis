**Smart Farming Automation System AI/ML Implementation Instructions**

### Outline

1. **Architecture**
	* IoT sensors will collect data on temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and other relevant factors
	* Data will be transmitted to a local farming device (e.g. Arduino-based) via WiFi
	* The farming device will run a machine learning model to predict optimal crop yields and detect potential issues
2. **Machine Learning Model**
	* Type: Regression-based model (e.g. Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
	* Input features: temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and other relevant factors
	* Output: predicted crop yield and issue detection (e.g. disease, pests)
3. **Local Inference**
	* The farming device will run the trained model to make predictions on new, incoming data
	* Predictions will be used to optimize crop yields and reduce waste

### Instructions for Engineer

1. **Choose a suitable machine learning library for C++**
	* Options: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Eigen
2. **Implement data preprocessing and feature engineering**
	* Clean and normalize incoming data from IoT sensors
	* Extract relevant features from the data
3. **Train a machine learning model using local data**
	* Use a regression-based model to predict optimal crop yields and detect potential issues
	* Train the model using historical data from the farm
4. **Implement local inference on the farming device**
	* Use the trained model to make predictions on new, incoming data
	* Optimize crop yields and reduce waste based on predictions
5. **Test and validate the implementation**
	* Use a separate test dataset to evaluate the model's performance
	* Validate the implementation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall

### Notes

* The implementation should be able to run on the local farming device (e.g. Arduino-based) without relying on external AI/ML services.
* The machine learning model should be trained using local data to ensure optimal performance and adaptability to the specific farm's conditions.
* The implementation should be able to handle varying amounts of data and make predictions in real-time to optimize crop yields and reduce waste.
