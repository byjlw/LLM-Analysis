THE IDEA
Create a smart waste management system that uses IoT sensors and machine learning algorithms to optimize waste collection and disposal in urban areas, reducing operational costs by up to 30% and increasing collection efficiency by 25%. The system should be able to detect waste levels in real-time, predict collection schedules based on historical data and seasonal trends, and provide real-time updates to waste management personnel via mobile apps and web portals. Implement a user-friendly interface for personnel to interact with the system, receive notifications, and update routes and schedules as needed, and ensure it is integrated with existing waste management infrastructure, including fleet management systems and customer service platforms. Success will be measured by a reduction in missed collections, decreased fuel consumption, and improved customer satisfaction ratings, with a goal of achieving a 95% collection rate and a 20% reduction in customer complaints within the first year of implementation.
