THE IDEA
Create a virtual event planning platform that allows users to plan and host virtual events, such as conferences, weddings, and meetups, with ease and flexibility, addressing the challenges of remote event organization, including difficulties in coordinating logistics, managing attendee engagement, and recreating the immersive experience of in-person events. The platform should include features such as event scheduling with automated reminders and notifications, attendee management with personalized invitations and tracking, and virtual venue customization with 3D visualization and branding options. Implement a user-friendly interface with intuitive navigation, real-time analytics, and seamless integrations with popular event tools, and ensure the platform is scalable to accommodate large numbers of attendees, secure with enterprise-grade encryption and compliance, and accessible on various devices and browsers. Success will be measured by the platform's ability to increase event attendance and engagement, reduce planning time and costs, and receive high user satisfaction ratings, with key performance indicators including a minimum of 90% customer retention rate, an average event attendance increase of 25%, and a 4.5-star user review rating.
