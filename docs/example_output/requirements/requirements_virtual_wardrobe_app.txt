THE IDEA
Develop a virtual wardrobe app, dubbed "StyleHub," that allows users to upload pictures of their clothing items and create a personalized virtual wardrobe, complete with categorized folders, tags, and searchable filters. The app should be able to provide outfit suggestions based on user-inputted events, occasions, and personal style preferences, as well as fashion recommendations from popular fashion influencers and bloggers. Additionally, the app should include virtual try-on capabilities using augmented reality (AR) technology, allowing users to see how outfits would look on them without having to physically try them on. Implement a user-friendly interface with features such as a virtual closet, outfit planner, and shopping list, and ensure the app is integrated with popular fashion brands and retailers, including online marketplaces like Net-a-Porter, Farfetch, and ASOS, to enable seamless shopping and styling experiences. Success will be measured by user engagement, with key metrics including the number of outfits created, virtual try-ons conducted, and purchases made through the app, as well as user retention and overall customer satisfaction.
