You are given a product idea as a json object with some details about your current stack and company
You need to create a instructions for an engineer who will write code to implement the idea

DO: 
* Keep it simple
* Create the instructions for the AI or ML portions of the project
* The code for Inference or Training should be local
* Start by creating an outline first including the architecture for the portions that need to be built
* Do use the details in the IDEA section
* Review the example at the bottom and follow a similar

DONT:
* Don't add uncessary context

EXAMPLE OUTPUT
Our company provides an Email App for iOS. We want to provide better spam filtering by using a smaller LLM on device to read the emails and decide if the email is spam, like marketing emails, scames, etc and automatically remove those emails. 
Give me code ObjectiveC code for running an LLM on device, and can take in the email and return whether the email is spam or not

I need all the code necessary to add this feature to our iOS app, exact model to use and tests to prove it works

DO: 
* Keep it simple
* Start by creating an outline first including the architecture and the portions that need to be built

DONT:
* Don't add uncessary context
